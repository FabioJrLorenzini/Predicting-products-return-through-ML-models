# Predicting_products_return_through_ML
## Enhancing Business Performance through Machine Learning models for Predictive Product Return Analysis

The project was undertaken with the aim of developing an optimized model for predicting product returns within the operational framework of a prominent retail fashion enterprise. The study leveraged a dataset derived from the company's 2022 sales records.

Key Project Activities:
1) Performed extensive exploration and analysis on a dataset comprising 7 million records, investigating insights among nearly 50 covariates.
2) Employed inferential statistics to determine the most pertinent attributes for the research.
3) Investigated and implemented a variety of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, LASSO, Principal Component Regression, and Neural Networks (using SAS Miner) as to identify the most effective model for predicting product returns.
